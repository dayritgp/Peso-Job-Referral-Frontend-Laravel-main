## About
### System
This system is developed for the Public Employment Service Office (PESO) of LGU - Gensan where it aims to make the Job Referral System of the office accessible online with the main key actors: job seeker and employer. The PESO currently has a running 'Referral System' however, it is solely managed by the PESO admin which slows down the process of referral procedures. Upon the analysis, the following are the identified issues and problems:
* All registration procedures are done manually through pen and paper.
* The PESO - Staff manually match employer and job seeker.
* The employer sent out job vacancy postings through email only.
* Manual tracking of job vacancy slots or availability.
comprises with three distinct type of users: job seekers, employers, and staff.
